\subsection{A Special Case of Post-FMSC Inference}
\label{sec:limitexperiment}
The preceding section presented two confidence interval that account for the effects of moment selection on subsequent inference.
The 1-Step interval is intuitive and computationally straightforward but lacks theoretical guarantees, while the 2-Step interval guarantees asymptotically valid inference at the cost of greater computational complexity and conservatism.
To better understand these methods and the trade-offs involved in deciding between them, I now specialize them to the two examples of FMSC selection that appear in the simulation studies described below.
The structure of these examples allows us to bypass Algorithm \ref{alg:conf} and characterize the asymptotic properties of various proposals for post-FMSC without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations.
Because this section presents asymptotic results, I treat any consistently estimable quantity that appears in a limit distribution as known.

In both the OLS versus IV example from Section \ref{sec:OLSvsIVExample} and the slightly simplified version of the choosing instrument variables example implemented in Section \ref{sec:chooseIVsim}, the post-FMSC estimator $\widehat{\beta}_{FMSC}$ converges to a very convenient limit experiment.\footnote{The simplified version of the choosing instrumental variables example considers a single potentially endogenous instrument and imposes homoskedasticity.
  For more details see Section \ref{sec:chooseIVsim} and Appendix \ref{append:limitexperiment}.}
In particular, 
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{n}(\widehat{\beta}_{FMSC} - \beta) \overset{d}{\rightarrow}  \mathbf{1}\left\{ |T|<\sigma \sqrt{2} \right\} U +  \mathbf{1}\left\{ |T|\geq\sigma \sqrt{2} \right\} V.
  \label{eq:FMSCLimitExperiment}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  T = \sigma Z_1 + \tau, \quad
  U = \eta Z_2 + c\tau, \quad
  V = \eta Z_2 - c\sigma Z_1
\end{equation}
where $Z_1, Z_2$ are independent standard normal random variables, $\eta$, $\sigma$ and $c$ are consistently estimable constants, and $\tau$ is the local mis-specification parameter.
This representation allows us to tabulate the asymptotic distribution, $F_{FMSC}$ as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  F_{FMSC}(x) &=& G(x) + H_1(x) + H_2(x) \\
  \label{eq:FFMSC}
  G(x) &=& \Phi\left( \frac{x - c\tau}{\eta} \right)\left[ \Phi( \sqrt{2} - \tau/\sigma) -  \Phi( -\sqrt{2} - \tau/\sigma )\right]\\
  \label{eq:GFMSC}
  H_1(x) &=& \frac{1}{\sigma}\int_{-\infty}^{-\sigma\sqrt{2} - \tau} \Phi\left( \frac{x + ct}{\eta}\right)\varphi(t/\sigma)\; dt\\
  \label{eq:H1FMSC}
  H_2(x) &=& \frac{1}{\sigma}\int^{+\infty}_{\sigma\sqrt{2} - \tau} \Phi\left( \frac{x + ct}{\eta}\right)\varphi(t/\sigma)\; dt
  \label{eq:H2FMSC}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi$ is the CDF and $\varphi$ the pdf of a standard normal random variable.
Note that the limit distribution of the post-FMSC distribution depends on $\tau$ in addition to the consistently estimable quantities $\sigma, \eta, c$ although I suppress this dependence to simplify the notation.
While these expressions lack a closed form $G$, $H_1$ and $H_2$ are easy to compute, allowing us to calculate both $F_{FMSC}$ and the corresponding quantile function $Q_{FMSC}$\footnote{I provide code to evaluate both $F_{FMSC}$ and $Q_{FMSC}$ in my R package \texttt{fmscr}, available at \url{https://github.com/fditraglia/fmscr}.}

The ability to compute $F_{FMSC}$ and $Q_{FMSC}$ allows us to answer a number of important questions about post-FMSC inference.
First, suppose that we were to carry out FMSC selection and then construct a $(1 - \alpha) \times 100\%$ confidence interval \emph{conditional} in the selected estimator, completely ignoring the effects of the moment selection step.
What would be the resulting asymptotic coverage probability and width of such a ``na\"{i}ve'' confidence interval procedure?
Using calculations similar to those used above in the expression for $F_{FMSC}$, we find that the coverage probability of this na\"{i}ve interval is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mbox{CP}_{Naive}(\alpha) &=& G(u_\alpha) - G(-u_\alpha) +  H_1(\ell_\alpha) - H_2(-\ell_\alpha) +  H_2(\ell_\alpha) - H_2(-\ell_\alpha) \\
  u_\alpha &=& \Phi(1 - \alpha/2)\; \eta\\
  \ell_{\alpha} &=& \Phi(1 - \alpha/2) \sqrt{\eta^2 + c^2\sigma^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $G$, $H_1$, $H_2$ are as defined in Equations \ref{eq:GFMSC}--\ref{eq:H2FMSC}.
And since the width of this na\"{i}ve CI equals that of the textbook interval for $\widehat{\beta}$ when $|\widehat{\tau}|<\sigma\sqrt{2}$ and that of the textbook interval for $\widetilde{\beta}$ otherwise, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{E\left[ \mbox{Width}_{Naive}(\alpha) \right]}{\mbox{Width}_{Valid}(\alpha)} = 1 + \left[ \Phi( \sqrt{2} - \tau/\sigma) -  \Phi( -\sqrt{2} - \tau/\sigma )\right]\left( \sqrt{\frac{\eta^2}{\eta^2 + c^2 \sigma^2}} - 1 \right)
\end{equation*}
where $\mbox{Width}_{Valid}(\alpha)$ is the width of a standard, textbook confidence interval for $\widetilde{\beta}$.

To evaluate these expressions we need values for $c, \eta^2, \sigma^2$ and $\tau$.
For the remainder of this section I will consider the parameter values that correspond to the simulation experiments presented below in Section \ref{sec:simulations}.
For the OLS versus TSLS example we have $c=1$, $\eta^2=1$ and $\sigma^2 = (1-\pi^2)/\pi^2$ where $\pi^2$ denotes the population first-stage R-squared for the TSLS estimator. 
For the choosing IVs example we have $c =\gamma/(\gamma^2 +1/9)$, $\eta^2 = 1/(\gamma^2 + 1/9)$ and $\sigma^2 = 1 + 9\gamma^2$ where $\gamma^2$ is the increase in the population first-stage R-squared of the TSLS estimator from \emph{adding} $w$ to the instrument set.\footnote{The population first-stage R-squared with only $\mathbf{z}$ in the instument set is $1/9$.}

Table \ref{tab:LimitNaiveCover} presents the asymptotic coverage probability and Table \ref{tab:LimitNaiveWidth} the expected relative width of the na\"{i}ve confidence interval procedure for a variety of values of $\tau$ and $\alpha$ for each of the two examples.
For the OLS versus TSLS example, I allow $\pi^2$ to vary while for the choosing IVs example I allow $\gamma^2$ to vary.
Note that the relative expected width does not depend on $\alpha$.
In terms of coverage probability, the na\"{i}ve interval performs very poorly: in some regions of the parameter space the actual coverage is very close to the nominal level, while in others it is far lower.
These striking size distortions, which echo the findings of \cite{Guggenberger2010} and \cite{Guggenberger2012}, provide a strong argument against the use of the na\"{i}ve interval.
Its attraction, of course, is width: the na\"{i}ve interval can be dramatically shorter than the corresponding ``textbook'' confidence interval for the valid estimator.


Is there any way to construct a post-FMSC confidence interval that does not suffer from the egregious size distortions of the na\"{i}ve interval but is still shorter than the textbook interval for the valid estimator?
As a first step towards answering this question, Table \ref{tab:WidthInfeasible} presents the relative width of the shortest possible \emph{infeasible} post-FMSC confidence interval constructed directly from $Q_{FMSC}$.
This interval has asymptotic coverage probability \emph{exactly} equal to its nominal level as it correctly accounts for the effect of moment selection on the asymptotic distribution of the estimators.
Unfortunately it cannot be used in practice because it requires knowledge of $\tau$, for which no consistent estimator exists.
As such, this interval serves as a benchmark against which to judge various feasible procedures that do not require knowledge of $\tau$.
For certain parameter values this interval is indeed shorter than the valid interval but the improvement is not uniform.
Just as the FMSC itself cannot provide a uniform reduction in AMSE relative to the valid estimator, the infeasible post-FMSC cannot provide a corresponding reduction in width.
In both cases, however, improvements are possible when $\tau$ is expected to be small, the setting in which this paper assumes that an applied researcher finds herself. 
The potential reductions in width can be particularly dramatic for larger values of $\alpha$.
The question remains: is there any way to capture these gains using a \emph{feasible} procedure?

Now, consider the 2-Step confidence interval procedure from Algorithm \ref{alg:conf}.
We can implement an equivalent procedure without simulation as follows.
First we construct a $(1-\alpha_1)\times 100\%$ confidence interval for $\widehat{\tau}$ using $T = \sigma Z_1 + \tau$ where $Z_1$ is standard normal.
Next we construct a $(1-\alpha_2)\times 100\%$ based on $Q_{FMSC}$ for each $\tau^*$ in this interval.
Finally we take the upper and lower bounds over all of the resulting intervals.
This interval is guaranteed to have asymptotic coverage probability of at least $1 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)$ by an argument essentially identical to the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:sim}.
Protection against under-coverage, however, comes at the expense of extreme conservatism, particularly for larger values of $\alpha$.
Numerical values for the coverage and median expected with of this interval appear in Appendix \ref{append:limitexperiment_2step}. 
From both the numerical calculations and the theoretical result given in Theorem \ref{thm:sim} and these numerical calculations we see that the 2-Step systematically \emph{over-covers} and hence \emph{cannot} produce an interval shorter than the textbook CI for the valid estimator.

Now consider the 1-Step confidence interval from Algorithm \ref{alg:1step}. 
Rather than first constructing a confidence region for $\tau$ and then taking upper and lower bounds, 1-Step interval simply takes $\widehat{\tau}$ in place of $\tau$ and then constructs a confidence interval from $Q_{FMSC}$ exactly as in the infeasible interval described above.\footnote{As in the construction of the na\"{i}ve interval, I take the shortest possible interval based on $Q_{FMSC}$ rather than an equal-tailed interval. Additional results for an equal-tailed version of this one-step procedure are available upon request. Their performance is similar.}
Unlike its 2-Step counterpart, this interval comes with no generic theoretical guarantees, so I use the characterization from above to directly calculate its asymptotic coverage and expected relative width.
The results appear in Tables \ref{tab:Limit1StepShortOLSvsIV} and \ref{tab:Limit1StepShortChooseIVs}.
The 1-Step interval effectively ``splits the difference'' between the two-step interval and the na\"{i}ve procedure. 
While it can under-cover, the size distortions are quite small, particularly for $\alpha=0.1$ and $0.05$.
At the same time, when $\tau$ is relatively small this procedure can yield shorter intervals.
While a full investigation of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of the present paper, these calculations suggest a plausible way forward for post-FMSC inference that is less conservative than the two-step procedure from Algorithm \ref{alg:conf} by directly calculating the relevant quantities from the limit distribution of interest.
This is possible because $\pi$ and $\gamma^2$ are both consistently estimable.
And for any particular value of these parameters, the worst-case value of $\tau$ is \emph{interior}.
Using this idea, one could imagine specifying a maximum allowable size distortion and then designing a confidence interval to minimize width, possibly incorporating some prior restriction on the likely magnitude of $\tau$.
Just as the FMSC aims to achieve a favorable trade-off between bias and variance, such a confidence interval procedure could aim to achieve a favorable trade-off between width and coverage.
It would also be interesting to pursue analogous calculations for the minimum AMSE averaging estimator from Section \ref{sec:momentavgexample}.
