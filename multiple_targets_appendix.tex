\section{The Case of Multiple Target Parameters}
\label{append:mult}
  The fundamental idea behind the FMSC is to approximate finite-sample risk with asymptotic risk under local mis-specification.
  Although the discussion given above is restricted to a scalar target parameter, the same basic idea is easily extended to accomodate a vector of target parameters.
  All that is required is to specify an appropriate risk function.
  Consider a generic weighted quadratic risk function of the form
  \[
    R(\widehat{\theta}_S,W) = E\left[ \left( \widehat{\theta}_S - \theta_0 \right)' W \left( \widehat{\theta} - \theta_0 \right)\right]
  \]
  where $W$ is a positive semi-definite matrix.
  The finite-sample distribution of $\widehat{\theta}$ is, in general, unknown, but by Theorem \ref{thm:normality} $\sqrt{n} \left( \widehat{\theta}_S - \theta_0\right) \rightarrow_d U_S$ where
  \[
    U_S = -K_S \Xi_S \left( M + \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      0 \\ \tau
    \end{array}
  \right]\right)
  \]
  and $M\sim N(0,\Omega)$ so we instead consider the \emph{asymptotic risk}
  \begin{equation*}
    AR(\widehat{\theta}_S, W) = E\left[ U_S' W U_S \right] =
     \mbox{trace}\left\{ W^{1/2}K_S \Xi_S 
      \left( \left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        0 & 0 \\
        0 & \tau \tau'
      \end{array}
    \right] + \Omega\right)
    \Xi_S' K_S'W^{1/2} \right\}
  \end{equation*}
  where $W^{1/2}$ is the symmetric, positive semi-definite square root of $W$.
  To construct an asymptotically unbiased estimator of $AR(\widehat{\theta}_S, W)$ we substitute consistent estimators of $\Omega$ and $K_S$ and the asymptotically unbiased estimator of $\widehat{\tau}\widehat{\tau}'$ from Corollary \ref{cor:tautau} yielding
  \[
    \widehat{AR}\left( \widehat{\theta}_S, W \right) = 
    \mbox{trace}\left\{ W^{1/2}\widehat{K}_S \Xi_S 
      \left( \left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        0 & 0 \\
        0 & \widehat{\tau}\widehat{\tau}' - \widehat{\Psi}\widehat{\Omega}\widehat{\Psi}
      \end{array}
    \right] + \Omega\right)
    \Xi_S' \widehat{K}_S'W^{1/2} \right\}
  \]
  which is nearly identical to the expression for the FMSC given in Equation \ref{eq:fmsc}.
  The only difference is the presence of the weighting matrix $W$ and the trace operator in place of the vector of derivatives $\nabla_\theta\mu(\widehat{\theta})$.
  When $W$ is a diagonal matrix this difference disappears completely as this effectively amounts to defining a target parameter that is a weighted average of some subset of the elements of $\theta$.
  In this case the FMSC can be used without modification simply by defining the function $\mu$ appropriately.
