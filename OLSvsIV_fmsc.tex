\subsection{FMSC for OLS versus TSLS Example}
\label{sec:FMSCforOLSvsIV}
The FMSC has a particularly convenient and transparent form in the OLS versus TSLS example introduced in Section \ref{sec:OLSvsIVlowlevel}.
Since the target parameter in this case is simply $\beta$, the FMSC amounts to comparing the AMSE of OLS to that of TSLS. As an immediate consequence of Theorem \ref{thm:OLSvsIV}, 
$$\mbox{AMSE(OLS)} = \frac{\tau^2}{\sigma_x^4} + \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}{\sigma_x^2},\quad \quad
  \mbox{AMSE(TSLS)} = \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}{\gamma^2}.$$
 Rearranging, we see that the AMSE of the OLS estimator is strictly less than that of the TSLS estimator whenever $\tau^2  < \sigma_x^2 \sigma_\epsilon^2\sigma_v^2/\gamma^2$. 
 Using this expression for moment selection, of course, requires estimates of the unknown parameters.
 Fortunately, the familiar estimators of $\sigma_x^2, \gamma^2$, and $\sigma_v^2$ remain consistent under Assumption \ref{assump:OLSvsIV}.
 I set:
 $$\widehat{\sigma}_x^2 = n^{-1}\mathbf{x}'\mathbf{x}, \quad \widehat{\gamma}^2 = n^{-1}\mathbf{x}'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'\mathbf{x}, \quad \widehat{\sigma}_v^2 =  \widehat{\sigma}_x^2 - \widehat{\gamma}^2.$$
To estimate $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ there are two choices: one can either use the residuals from the OLS estimator or those from the TSLS estimator.
Under local mis-specification, both provide consistent estimators of $\sigma_\epsilon^2$. 
Of the two, the estimator based on the TSLS residuals should be more robust, however, unless the instruments are quite weak. 
This is because the exogeneity of $x$, even though it disappears in the limit under our asymptotics, is non-zero in finite samples. 
Thus, I use
	$$\widehat{\sigma}_\epsilon^2 = n^{-1}\left(\textbf{y} - \textbf{x}\widetilde{\beta}_{TSLS} \right)'\left(\textbf{y} - \textbf{x}\widetilde{\beta}_{TSLS} \right)$$
to estimate $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ below. 
All that remains is to estimate $\tau^2$. Specializing Theorem \ref{thm:tau} and Corollary \ref{cor:tautau} to the present example gives the following result.
\begin{thm}
	\label{thm:tauOLSvsIV}
	Let $\widehat{\tau} =  n^{-1/2} \mathbf{x}'(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{x}\widetilde{\beta}_{TSLS})$. Under Assumption \ref{assump:OLSvsIV} we have 
	$$\widehat{\tau}\rightarrow_d N(\tau,V), \quad V = \sigma_\epsilon^2 \sigma_x^2(\sigma_v^2/\gamma^2).$$ 
\end{thm}
It follows that $\widehat{\tau}^2 -  \widehat{\sigma}_\epsilon^2\widehat{\sigma}_x^2 \left(\widehat{\sigma}_v^2/\widehat{\gamma}^2\right)$ is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of $\tau^2$ and hence, substituting into the AMSE inequality from above and rearranging, the FMSC instructs us to choose OLS whenever $\widehat{T}_{FMSC} = \widehat{\tau}^2/\widehat{V} < 2$
where $\widehat{V} = \widehat{\sigma}_v^2 \widehat{\sigma}_\epsilon^2 \widehat{\sigma}_x^2/\widehat{\gamma}^2$. 
The quantity $\widehat{T}_{FMSC}$ looks very much like a test statistic and indeed it can be viewed as such. 
By Theorem \ref{thm:tauOLSvsIV} and the continuous mapping theorem, $\widehat{T}_{FMSC} \rightarrow_d \chi^2(1)$. 
Thus, the FMSC can be viewed as a test of the null hypothesis $H_0\colon \tau = 0$ against the two-sided alternative with a critical value of $2$. 
This corresponds to a significance level of $\alpha \approx 0.16$. 
But how does this novel ``test'' compare to something more familiar, say the Durbin-Hausman-Wu (DHW) test? 
It turns out that in this particular example, although not in general, carrying out moment selection via the FMSC is \emph{numerically equivalent} to using OLS unless the DHW test rejects at the 16\% level. 
\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:DHW} Under Assumption \ref{assump:OLSvsIV}, FMSC selection between the OLS and TSLS estimators is equivalent to a Durbin-Hausman-Wu pre-test with a critical value of $2$.
\end{thm}
The equivalence between FMSC selection and a DHW test in this example is helpful for two reasons. 
First, it provides a novel justification for the use of the DHW test to select between OLS and TSLS. So long as it is carried out with $\alpha \approx 16\%$, the DHW test is equivalent to selecting the estimator that minimizes an asymptotically unbiased estimator of AMSE. 
Note that this significance level differs from the more usual values of 5\% or 10\% in that it leads us to select TSLS \emph{more often}: OLS should indeed be given the benefit of the doubt, but not by so wide a margin as traditional practice suggests. 
Second, this equivalence shows that the FMSC can be viewed as an \emph{extension} of the idea behind the familiar DHW test to more general GMM environments.
