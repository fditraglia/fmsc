This paper is fully replicable using freely available, open-source software.
For full source code and replication details, see \url{https://github.com/fditraglia/fmsc}.
Results for the simulation studies and empirical example were generated using \texttt{R} \citep{R} and C\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny\textbf{++}} via the \texttt{Rcpp} \citep{RcppArticle,RcppBook} and \texttt{RcppArmadillo} \citep{RcppArmadillo} packages.
\texttt{RcppArmadillo} provides an interface to the Armadillo C\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny\textbf{++}} linear algebra library \citep{Armadillo}.
All figures in the paper were converted to tikz using the \texttt{tikzDevice} package \citep{tikzDevice}.
Confidence interval calculations for Sections \ref{sec:limitexperiment} and \ref{sec:CIsim} rely routines from my R package \texttt{fmscr}, available from \url{https://github.com/fditraglia/fmscr}.
The simulation-based intervals for the empirical example from Section \ref{sec:application} were constructed following Algorithm \ref{alg:conf} with  $J = 10,000$ using a mesh-adaptive search algorithm provided by the NOMAD C\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny\textbf{++}} optimization package \citep{NOMADalgorithm,NOMADcode,NOMADuserguide}, called from R using the \texttt{crs} package \citep{crs}.
TSLS results for Table \ref{tab:fullresults} were generated using version 3.1-4 of the \texttt{sem} package \citep{sem}.
