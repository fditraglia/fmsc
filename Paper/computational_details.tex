\section{Computational Details}
\label{append:comp}
Everything is fully replicable using free, open-source software.
Replication details along with full source code for simulations, the empirical example, and indeed this paper itself appear in the github repo.
LINK TO GITHUB REPO GOES HERE.
Mac OS X version 10.7.5, R version 3.1.0 ``Spring Dance,'' RcppArmadillo version 0.4.300.8.0, Rcpp version 0.11.2.
Provides an interface to the Armadillo C++ linear algebra library, version 4.300. 

For the simulation studies in which $\tau$ is one-dimensional, optimization by a simple grid search over 100 equally-spaced points in the CI with 1000 sim reps for the numerical integration.
In the empirical example, used mesh adaptive search (MADS) algorithm provided by the NOMAD C++ optimization package (version 3.6), called from R using the crs package (version 0.15-22)
