\section{Empirical Example: Geography or Institutions?}
\label{sec:application}
\cite{Carstensen2006} address a controversial question from the development literature: does geography directly effect income after controlling for institutions? 
A number of well-known studies find little or no direct effect of geographic endowments \citep{Acemoglu,Rodrik,Easterly}. \cite{Sachs}, on the other hand, shows that malaria transmission, a variable largely driven by ecological conditions, directly influences the level of per capita income, even after controlling for institutions. Because malaria transmission is very likely endogenous, Sachs uses a measure of ``malaria ecology,'' constructed to be exogenous both to present economic conditions and public health interventions, as an instrument. 
\cite{Carstensen2006} address the robustness of Sachs's results using the following baseline regression for a sample of 44 countries:
\begin{equation}
	\mbox{ln\emph{gdpc}}_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot \mbox{\emph{institutions}}_i + \beta_3 \cdot \mbox{\emph{malaria}}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
Treating both institutions and malaria transmission as endogenous, they consider a variety of measures of each and a number of instrument sets. 
In each case, they find large negative effects of malaria transmission, lending support to Sach's conclusion.

In this section, I revisit the instrument selection exercise given in Table 2 of \cite{Carstensen2006} using the FMSC and corrected confidence intervals described above. I consider two questions. 
First, based on the FMSC methodology, which instruments should we choose if our target parameter is $\beta_3$, the effect of malaria transmission on per capita income?
Does the selected instrument set change if our target parameter is $\beta_2$, the effect of institutions?
Second, are the results presented in \cite{Carstensen2006} robust to the effects of instrument selection on inference?
All results given here are calculated by 2SLS using the formulas from Section \ref{sec:chooseIVFMSC} and the variables described in Table \ref{tab:desc}. 
In keeping with Table 2 of \cite{Carstensen2006}, I use ln\emph{gdpc} as the dependent variable and \emph{rule} and \emph{malfal} as measures of institutions and malaria transmission throughout.

To apply the FMSC to the present example, we require a minimum of two valid instruments besides the constant term. 
Based on the arguments given in \cite{Acemoglu}, \cite{Carstensen2006} and \cite{Sachs}, I proceed under the assumption that ln\emph{mort} and \emph{maleco}, measures of early settler mortality and malaria ecology, are exogenous.
Rather than selecting over all 128 possible instrument sets, I consider eight specifications formed from four sets of instrument ``blocks'' defined by \cite{Carstensen2006}.
The baseline block contains ln\emph{mort}, \emph{maleco} and a constant; the climate block contains \emph{frost}, \emph{humid}, and \emph{latitude}; the Europe block contains \emph{eurfrac} and \emph{engfrac}; and the openness block contains \emph{coast} and \emph{trade}. 
Full descriptions of these variables appear in Table \ref{tab:desc}.
Table \ref{tab:fullresults} lists the eight instrument sets considered here, along with 2SLS estimates and traditional 95\% confidence intervals for all instrument sets considered here.\footnote{The results presented in Table \ref{tab:fullresults} are virtually identical to those of \cite{Carstensen2006}. The slight discrepancy in the results for the baseline instrument set, Panel 1, comes from the fact that \cite{Carstensen2006} include an additional observation for this specification: Vietnam. Because the climate, Europe and openness instruments are missing for this country, I exclude it in the interest of consistency.}

\caption{Two-stage least squares estimation results for all instrument sets.}
\label{tab:fullresults}

\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:FMSC_values} presents FMSC and positive-part FMSC results for instrument sets 1--8  as defined in Table \ref{tab:fullresults}. 
As described above, the positive-part FMSC sets a negative squared asymptotic bias estimate to zero when esimating AMSE.
When the squared bias estimate is positive, the FMSC and positive-part FMSC coincide; when the squared bias estimate is negative, the positive-part FMSC is strictly larger than the FMSC. 
The table presents two cases: the first takes the effect of \emph{malfal}, a measure of malaria transmission, as the target parameter while the second uses the effect of \emph{rule}, a measure of institutions. 
In each, the two best instrument sets are numbers 5 (baseline, climate and Europe) and 8 (all instruments).\footnote{In Table 2 of their paper, \cite{Carstensen2006} report GMM-BIC and HQ results for selection over instrument sets 2--4 and 8 that favor instrument set 8. They do not consider instrument sets 5--7. however.}
When the target parameter is the coefficient on \emph{malfal}, 8 is the clear winner under both the plain-vanilla and positive-part FMSC, leading to an estimate of $-1.08$ for the effect of malaria transmission on per-capita income.
When the target parameter is the coefficient on \emph{rule}, however, instrument sets 5 and 8 are virtually indistinguishable.
Indeed, while the plain-vanilla FMSC selects instrument set 8, leading to an estimate of $0.84$ for the effect of instutitions on per-capita income, the positive-part FMSC selects instrument set 5, leading to an estimate of $0.93$. 
Thus the FMSC methodology shows that, while helpful for estimating the effect of malaria transmission, the openness instruments \emph{coast} and \emph{trade} provide essentially no additional information when estimating the effect of institutions.

Table \ref{tab:postFMSC_CIs} presents three alternative post-selection confidence intervals for each of the instrument selection exercises from Table \ref{tab:FMSC_values}: ``Na\"{i}ve,'' ``1-Step'' and ``2-step.''
The Na\"{i}ve intervals are standard, nominal 95\% confidence intervals that ignore the fact that we have carried out instrument selection. 
There are constructed by simply identifying the selected instrument set from Table \ref{tab:FMSC_values} and reporting the corresponding nominal 95\% interval from Table \ref{tab:fullresults}.
These intervals ignore both the additional uncertainty that comes from instrument selection -- if the data had been slightly different we would have chosen a different estimator -- and the fact that some of the instruments used in estimation may in fact be endogenous.\footnote{For more discussion of this point, see the introduction to Section \ref{sec:avg}.}
The 1-Step intervals are simulation-based nominal 95\% intervals constructed using a simplified, and less computationally intensive, version of the procedure given in Algorithm \ref{alg:conf}.
Rather than taking the minimum lower confidence limit and maximum upper confidence limit over all values in a given confidence region for $\tau$, this procedure simply assumes that the estimated value $\widehat{\tau}$ equals the true value and generates $10,000$ simulations for $\Lambda$ with $\tau^* =\widehat{\tau}$ \emph{only}.
Accordingly, it constructs a confidence interval for $\widehat{\mu}$ using simulations $\{\Lambda_j(\widehat{\tau})\}_{j=1}^J$ \emph{only} with $J = 10,000$.
Neither the Na\"{i}ve nor the 1-Step procedures yield valid 95\% confidence intervals.
They are provided merely for comparison with the 2-Step procedure, which fully implements Algorithm \ref{alg:conf} with $\alpha = \delta = 0.05$ and $J=10,000$. As explained above, the 2-Step interval is guaranteed to have asymptotic coverage probability of \emph{at least} $1 - \alpha - \delta$ , in this case 90\%.
From the 2-Step intervals, we see that the results of \cite{Carstensen2006} are \emph{highly robust}. 
There is no evidence that accounting for the effects of instrument selection changes our conclusions about the sign or significance of \emph{malfal} or \emph{rule}.

This is admittedly a simple example, but its simplity is deliberate. 

This example is as simple as possible, but no simpler.
This is admittedly a simple example in certain respects.
Indeed, the second stage only contains two regressors and a constant.



While this is admittedly a simple example in certain respects -- indeed, the second stage only contains only two regressors and a constant -- 

The calculations required for the FMSC and positive-part FMSC are trivial on a modern machine: they simply require that we fit each specification under consideration and store the usual quantities associated with them.
Even with a complicated first-stage and hundreds of instrument sets under consideration, the time required is measured in seconds rather than minutes.
The true computational cost comes from the two-stage confidence interval procedure and depends solely on the \emph{number of suspect instruments in the full instrument set}.
Here there are seven, so we need to carry out constrained optimization of a stochastic objective function in seven dimensions \emph{twice}: once for the lower confidence limit and again for the upper confidence limit.
This empirical example was chosen to be as simple as possible in all respects that do not materially affect the computational complexity while being realistic in those that do
