\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
This paper has introduced the FMSC, a proposal to choose moment conditions using AMSE. 
The criterion performs well in simulations, and the framework used to derive it allows us to construct valid confidence intervals for moment average and post-selection estimators.  
While I focus here on an cross-section application, the FMSC could prove useful in any context in which moment conditions arise from more than one source. 
In a panel model, for example, the assumption of contemporaneously exogenous instruments may be plausible while that of predetermined instruments is more dubious.
Using the FMSC, we could assess whether the extra information contained in the lagged instruments outweighs their potential invalidity. 
In a macro model, measurement error could be present in the intra--Euler equation but not the \emph{inter}--Euler equation, as considered by \cite{Eichenbaum}. 
The FMSC could be used to select over the intra-Euler moment conditions.
