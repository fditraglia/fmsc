In finite samples, the use of a slightly endogenous but highly relevant instrument can reduce mean-squared error (MSE). Building on this observation, I propose a moment selection criterion for GMM in which moment conditions are chosen based on the MSE of their associated estimators rather than their validity: the focused moment selection criterion (FMSC). 
I then show how the framework used to derive the FMSC can address the problem of inference post-moment selection.
Treating post-selection estimators as a special case of moment-averaging, in which estimators based on different moment sets are given data-dependent weights, I propose  simulation-based procedures for inference that can be applied to a variety of formal and informal moment-selection and averaging procedures.
Both the FMSC and confidence interval procedures perform well in simulations.
I conclude with an empirical example examining the effect of instrument selection on the estimated relationship between malaria and income.
